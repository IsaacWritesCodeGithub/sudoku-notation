## Why?

This was inspired by a conversation based on Cracking The Cryptic's new book that is coming out, and how the last one had a lot of erroneous puzzles. I realized that there's not any standarized sudoku notation to share variant Sudokus reliably.

## How is this supposed to work?

The goal of the repo is not to just make the notation, it's also to make a notation -> image generator and viceversa.

## What do we need to support?

You can find everything we need to support in ./Things to support.md

## How is this notation supposed to work?

This is an example puzzle with no digits nor variants on the board. The name of the puzzle is "The path" and the author is "Megumi". The size of the puzzle is 9x9.

`The path/Megumi/0909/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0`

## Variants/Modifiers:
